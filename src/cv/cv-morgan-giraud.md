### PROFILE SUMMARY

Passionate ML & Web engineer, skilled in Python, and its diverse set of ML frameworks (TF, PyTorch, JAX). Also skilled in JS/TS and web app engineering. Proficient in working with on-site and remote diverse teams.

Notable experiences:

- Being a core original contributor to the open-source library, [tf-encrypted](https://tf-encrypted.io/), for privacy-preserving machine learning in TensorFlow, which was accepted at the NeurIPS 2018 PPML workshop
- My research internship on Gounded language learning and modality fusion for which you can find the [annotated slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MKxizuQflOzxMjbv_sUYUOTsE_oWZ-g02TQzwOFdNtg)
- Founded a company in 2012 called Explee, an online platform for creating animated videos.

### SKILLS

- Proficient in Python with experience in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Jax (Local and Distributed Settings).
- Strong knowledge in infrastructure engineering (AWS, Docker, Linux) and management (CI/CD, git, etc.).
- Average knowledge of CUDA and Triton.
- Notion of C++ and Golang.
- Proficient in TypeScript/JavaScript and PHP.
- Fluent in French and English, with limited working proficiency in Italian.

### RESEARCH & ENGINEERING INTERESTS

- ML scalability: Reducing the need for compute by improving data and models efficiency, and building scalable infrastructure and algorithms for ML research and deployments.
- Traditional-ML enhanced LLMs: especially LLMs enhanced with external planner, critics and verifiers.
- Explainable/Interpretable Machine Learning: developing tools to open-up the blackbox.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially Multi-agent RL and LLM-enhanced agents to improve human-agent interactions.
