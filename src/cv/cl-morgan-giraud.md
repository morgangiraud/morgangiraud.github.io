Hi!

With a rich background in machine learning engineering and team leadership, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to your team.

Over the years, I've been actively involved in open-source projects like tf-encrypted (distributed computing) and have taken the lead in developing innovative ML applications. My technical strengths are rooted in Python and its ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX), as well as in infrastructure engineering (AWS, Docker, Linux) and management tools. Additionally, I have some knowledge of CUDA and Triton.

My past experiences include leading projects in web technology, build various ML applications and softwares, teaching and co-founding a tech startup, which has equipped me with a broad perspective and versatile skill set.

I am excited about the possibility of joining your team and contributing in a meaningful way. I look forward to discuss how I can be of any help for your team's objectives.

Kind regards,

Morgan Giraud
